### Minor Changes

- [#64](https://github.com/AshikNesin/groot/pull/64) [`ae54b49`](https://github.com/AshikNesin/groot/commit/ae54b4920f39b2dbd9432298855210cb4752cd57) Thanks [@AshikNesin](https://github.com/AshikNesin)! - refactor: reorganize codebase architecture

  - Flattened the `packages/` directory, merging `server`, `logger`, and `database` into `core`.
  - Renamed `client` to `shell`.
  - Moved boilerplate `auth`, `settings`, and `storage` modules out of `apps/web/src/client/pages` and into `@groot/shell`.
  - Replaced all legacy paths with their new equivalents in all codebase documentation, tests, and comments.
