## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`83b3a6f`](https://github.com/AshikNesin/groot/commit/83b3a6f1ce34a28299b00f18645faabf3e9569a8) Thanks [@AshikNesin](https://github.com/AshikNesin)! - refactor: unify API client, form handling, and server response flow

  A cross-cutting refactor of how the frontend talks to the API and how
  controllers shape responses, plus a shared Form primitive.

  ## @groot/core

  - Removed the `*System` namespace barrels (`AISystem`, `AuthSystem`,
    `ErrorSystem`, `KVSystem`, plus the passkey/settings/storage equivalents).
    Callers now use direct named imports instead of convenience namespaces.
  - Added `utils/controller.utils.ts` with `requireUser(req)` and
    `validatedBody<T>(req)` helpers, replacing repeated inline `req.user` /
    `req.body as` boilerplate across controllers.
  - Added `utils/api-response.utils.ts` to standardize controller response
    shapes.
  - Extracted shared Zod field shapes (`emailField`, `passwordField`) in
    `auth.validation.ts` so the client can reuse them for form validation
    (single source of truth).
  - Streamlined `error-handler`, `error-response`, `route-handler`, and
    `validation` middlewares.

  ## @groot/ui

  - Added a `Form` component (`form.tsx`) with `react-hook-form` integration and
    field helpers.

  ## @groot/shell

  - Reworked `lib/api.ts` (the `apiClient`) for simpler, more consistent request
    handling.
  - Added `useToastMutation` hook to standardize mutation + toast feedback.
  - Refactored `Login`, storage dialogs (`CreateFolderDialog`, `RenameDialog`),
    `PasskeyManager`, `AppSettings`, and the `useStorage` / `useAppSettings`
    hooks to build on the new Form component and apiClient.

  ## @groot/jobs

  - Refactored the client API layer (`api.ts`), `useJobs`, `useJobDetail`, and
    `JobsTable` to align with the new apiClient patterns.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#64](https://github.com/AshikNesin/groot/pull/64) [`ae54b49`](https://github.com/AshikNesin/groot/commit/ae54b4920f39b2dbd9432298855210cb4752cd57) Thanks [@AshikNesin](https://github.com/AshikNesin)! - refactor: reorganize codebase architecture

  - Flattened the `packages/` directory, merging `server`, `logger`, and `database` into `core`.
  - Renamed `client` to `shell`.
  - Moved boilerplate `auth`, `settings`, and `storage` modules out of `apps/web/src/client/pages` and into `@groot/shell`.
  - Replaced all legacy paths with their new equivalents in all codebase documentation, tests, and comments.
